# Microsoft Graph Webhook Sample for Node.js

This Node.js sample shows how to start getting notifications from Microsoft Graph. The following are common tasks that a web application performs with Microsoft Graph webhooks:

1. Sign-in your users with their work or school account to get an access token.
2. Use the access token to create a webhook subscription.
3. Send back a validation token to confirm the notification URL.
4. Listen for notifications from Microsoft Graph.
5. Request for more information in Office 365 using data in the notification.

The previous screenshot shows the app in action. After your app gets a subscription, your app gets a notification when events happen in user data. Your app can then react to the event. This sample writes a list item for every notification received by the notification URL.

## Prerequisites

To use the Webhook sample, you need the following:

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 4 or 5.
* A Bash shell. Windows developers can use [Git Bash for Windows](https://git-for-windows.github.io/) or Cygwin. Mac and Linux developers can use their standard terminals.

> Note: Try out the [Get started with Office 365 APIs](http://dev.office.com/getting-started/office365apis?platform=option-node#setup) page. It simplifies app registration on Microsoft Azure. If you follow the previous link, then you can skip the next prerequisites.

* An Office 365 account. You can sign up for [an Office 365 Developer subscription](https://portal.office.com/Signup/Signup.aspx?OfferId=6881A1CB-F4EB-4db3-9F18-388898DAF510&DL=DEVELOPERPACK&ali=1#0). The developer subscription includes resources to start building Office 365 apps.

     > Note: If you already have a subscription, the previous link sends the following message. Sorry, you canâ€™t add that to your current account. In that case, use an account from your current Office 365 subscription.
     
* A Microsoft Azure subscription to register your application. Azure Active Directory provides identity services for your application. You can use a [Microsoft Azure trial subscription](https://account.windowsazure.com/SignUp).

     > Important: You also need to make sure your Azure subscription is bound to your Office 365 tenant. To do this, see the blog post, [Creating and Managing Multiple Windows Azure Active Directories](http://blogs.technet.com/b/ad/archive/2013/11/08/creating-and-managing-multiple-windows-azure-active-directories.aspx). The section **Adding a new directory** explains how to do this. For more information, see [Associate your Office 365 account with Azure AD to create and manage apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_CreateAzureSubscription).
* A client ID and key of an application registered in Azure. [Add a web application in Azure](https://msdn.microsoft.com/office/office365/HowTo/add-common-consent-manually#bk_RegisterServerApp) and [grant the proper permissions](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-NodeJs-Webhooks/wiki/Grant-permissions-to-the-application-in-Azure) to it.

     > Note: During the app registration process, specify **http://localhost:3000/** as the **Sign-on URL**.
     
## Configure tunneling software for your localhost

Microsoft Graph needs a notification URL that it can reach to deliver notifications. The sample uses *localhost* as the development server. Microsoft Graph can't deliver notifications to *localhost*. For this reason, we need a tunnel that can forward requests from an URL on the internet to our *localhost*. For a more detailed explanation, see [Why do I have to use a tunnel?](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-NodeJs-Webhooks/wiki/Why-do-I-have-to-use-a-tunnel%3F). 

> Note: You can also choose to deploy the sample to a cloud service, such as Azure. If you rather deploy this sample to Azure, see [Deploying the sample to Azure
](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Graph-NodeJs-Webhooks/wiki/Deploying-the-sample-to-Azure).

For this sample, we use [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to create the tunnel. To configure ngrok:

1. [Download](https://ngrok.com/download) and unzip the ngrok binaries for your platform.
2. Type the following command
    
    `ngrok http 3000`.
3. Take note of the *https public URL* that ngrok provider for you. This is an example

    `https://<identifier>.ngrok.io`.

You'll need the *https public URL* in the next section.

## Configure and run the web app

1. Use a text editor to open `constants.js`.
2. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_CLIENT_ID* with the client ID of your registered Azure application.
3. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_SECRET* with the client secret of your registered Azure application.
4. Replace *ENTER_YOUR_NOTIFICATION_URL* with the *https public URL* from the previous section.
5. Install the dependencies running the following command:
    ```
    npm install
    ```

6. Start the application with the following command:
    ```
    npm start
    ```
    > Note: You can also make the application wait for a debugger. To wait for a debugger, use the following command instead:
    ```
    npm run debug
    ```
    You can attach the Visual Studio Code debugger. For more information, see [Debugging in Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/Docs/editor/debugging).
    
7. Open a browser and go to http://localhost:3000.
